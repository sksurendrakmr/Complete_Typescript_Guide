Typescript is a "Superset" to Javascript

Typescript adds static typing to Javascript
as Javascript on its own is dynamically typed

We cannot run Typescript directly in browser.
Therefore we need to compile typescript to Javascript

During that compilation process, all our type annotation will
be removed as javascript doesn't know those annotations
